Implement Queue using stack - enQueue O(1)
Implement Queue using two stack S1 and S2. You need to complete the push and pop function of Queue class. You are given 2 types of query 1 for push an integer into queue and 2 for enqueue the value from the queue and print.

Note: implement enQueue in O(1)

Input Format
First line contains q of queries.

Followed by q lines.

Query of type 1 is followed by an integer x to push element in the queue.

Query of type 2 is for dequeue the last value from the queue and print.

Output Format
Print the value for dequeue operations in the query given.

Example 1
Input

5
1 2
1 3
2
1 4
2
Output:

2 3
Explanation

First we push 2 , then for second query we push 3, for third query we dequeue 2 and print, for 4th query we push 4 and for 5th query we dequeue 3 and print.

Example 2
Input

3
2
1 2
2
Output:

-1 2
Explanation:

In the first query we don't have any element but we use dequeue query so we print -1, in the 2nd query we push 2 and in the 3rd we dequeue 2 and print 2.

Constraints
1 <= Total number of queries <= 100

1 <= value in each query <= 100
